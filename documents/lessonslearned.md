# Lessons Learned: Modularizing Your Python Project

## Overview
When building larger Python projects, it's essential to keep your code modular. This means separating your code into distinct files and folders, each dedicated to a specific purpose. Doing so ensures that your application remains clear, maintainable, and easy to expand. Below is a concise summary of refactoring opportunities and common categories you might use when organizing your Python application.

---

## 1. Refactoring Opportunities in `main.py`

1. **Logging Setup**  
   - **Category**: Utility Function  
   - **Purpose**: Configure and initialize logging.  
   - **Suggestion**: Move the `setup_logging` function to something like `utils/logging_utils.py`.

2. **Drawing Type Detection**  
   - **Category**: Utility Function  
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulate logic to determine the type of a drawing (e.g., based on filename).  
   - **Suggestion**: Put the `get_drawing_type` function in `utils/drawing_utils.py`.

3. **API Call Handling**  
   - **Category**: Utility Function  
   - **Purpose**: Manage safe API calls with retry or error handling.  
   - **Suggestion**: Extract the `async_safe_api_call` function to `utils/api_utils.py`.

4. **Batch Processing Logic**  
   - **Category**: Processing Logic / Business Logic  
   - **Purpose**: Handle processing of files in batches.  
   - **Suggestion**: Move `process_batch_async` into a dedicated module (e.g., `processing/batch_processor.py`).

5. **File Processing Logic**  
   - **Category**: Processing Logic / Business Logic  
   - **Purpose**: Handle logic for processing individual files (like PDFs).  
   - **Suggestion**: Place `process_pdf_async` into `processing/file_processor.py`.

## 2. Common Python Categories

Below are common categories (or “layers”) you might see in Python applications. Not all projects will need every category, but they can serve as guidelines:

1. **Utility Functions**  
   - **Role**: Provide stateless helpers (e.g., formatting, validation).
   - **Example**: `utils/file_utils.py`, `utils/string_utils.py`

2. **Business Logic / Processing Logic**  
   - **Role**: Encapsulate the core rules and operations of your application.
   - **Example**: `core/processing/batch_processor.py`

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**  
   - **Role**: Handle interactions with databases or data sources.
   - **Example**: `data_access/db_queries.py`

4. **Service Layer**  
   - **Role**: Coordinate between business logic and data access layers (often used in larger applications).
   - **Example**: `services/user_service.py`

5. **Presentation Layer**  
   - **Role**: Manage user-facing components (like web views or GUIs).
   - **Example**: `views/home_view.py` (in a web framework)

6. **Configuration**  
   - **Role**: Store app settings, constants, or environment variables.
   - **Example**: `config/settings.py`

7. **Error Handling**  
   - **Role**: Centralize exception handling and logging.
   - **Example**: `errors/exceptions.py`

8. **Testing**  
   - **Role**: Validate your code’s correctness through automated tests.
   - **Example**: `tests/test_batch_processor.py`

9. **Security**  
   - **Role**: Handle authentication, authorization, and data protection.
   - **Example**: `security/auth_middleware.py`

10. **Middleware** (mostly in web frameworks)  
    - **Role**: Process requests/responses in a pipeline before/after main logic.
    - **Example**: `middleware/request_logger.py`

11. **Plugins/Extensions**  
    - **Role**: Extend functionality without modifying the core codebase.
    - **Example**: `extensions/custom_logging.py`

12. **Domain Models**  
    - **Role**: Represent entities and their relationships in your domain.
    - **Example**: `models/user.py`

---

## 3. Role of `main.py` (or `app.py`)

Your `main.py` typically serves as the **entry point** and **orchestrator** for the application:

1. **Orchestration**  
   - High-level logic that defines the overall flow: setting up logging, configuring dependencies, and calling the key functions.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         setup_logging()
         process_batch_async("some_folder")
     ```

2. **Entry Point**  
   - Contains the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, ensuring certain code only runs when executed directly.

3. **Integration**  
   - Coordinates modules and components, “pulling them in” via imports.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     from utils.logging_utils import setup_logging
     from processing.batch_processor import process_batch_async
     ```

### Why Call It an “Orchestrator”?
- Because `main.py` (or `app.py`) is responsible for **coordinating** various parts of your application rather than doing all the work itself. This separation of concerns keeps the file clean and maintainable.

## 4. Benefits of This Structure

- **Readability**: Each file/module focuses on one purpose, making it easier to understand.
- **Reusability**: Common tasks (like logging, API calls) are extracted to utilities and can be reused.
- **Maintainability**: When changes are needed, you update just one module instead of combing through a huge file.
- **Scalability**: As your project grows, you can easily add new modules or services without overburdening `main.py`.

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **Refactor** repetitive or utility logic out of `main.py` to keep it concise.  
- **Organize** your code into logical categories (utilities, business logic, data access, etc.).  
- **Use** a central orchestrator (`main.py`) to tie everything together.  

By applying these practices, you’ll ensure your project is structured, clear, and easy to maintain as it evolves.
